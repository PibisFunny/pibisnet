  <p>Summer... is summer. I'm probably gonna publish this just so there's a decent snapshot of the site up for visitors...</p>

  <p>FINALLY getting some more stuff done, and check out that sick home button at the top</p>

  <p>I added a clock in PST (short for Pibis Standard Time) and a couple socials, and improved visibility of the splash screen's elements. Still need some icons, and I'd like to improve the wallpaper.
    <br> I also added a huge ugly red square to the main page in an attempt to stay relevant with the new generation

  <p>Back at it! I'm adding a buttons page because there were some really cool ones I saw where I was like "Yeah, I'd put that on my website!" and so I did.<br>
  I've also gotta clean up my pages some more, and add icons for the home page. Maybe list my socials there too.</p>

<p>Makes the page look a lot nicer; consistent theme and colors, as well as making it OBVIOUS when a link doesn't work yet. Also, Aario generator is back.<br>
NEXT: Awesome menu, better "wallpaper" (it's already no longer nauseating) and better updates page. Also, I'd at least like to get the website's claim to fame, the WEB'S LARGEST HOT DOG, working soon.<br>
Spring classes just started too, so this might be the newest update for some time... (ooh, it's midnight... April 9th now.)</p>
