<h3 style="background-color:lightseagreen;">Apr. 8, 2025 update log:</h3>
<p>Makes the page look a lot nicer; consistent theme and colors, as well as making it OBVIOUS when a link doesn't work yet. Also, Aario generator is back.<br>
NEXT: Awesome menu, better "wallpaper" (it's already no longer nauseating) and better updates page. Also, I'd at least like to get the website's claim to fame, the WEB'S LARGEST HOT DOG, working soon.<br>
Spring classes just started too, so this might be the newest update for some time... (ooh, it's midnight... April 9th now.)</p>
